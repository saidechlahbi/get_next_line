Here are the key differences between fopen() and open():
fopen():

From standard I/O library (stdio.h)
Higher-level, buffered file operations
Returns FILE*
Easier to use for text files
Provides formatted input/output
Uses modes like "r", "w", "a"

open():

Low-level UNIX system call (unistd.h, fcntl.h)
Unbuffered, raw file operations
Returns file descriptor (integer)
More direct, lower-level access
Used for binary files and system-level operations
Uses flags like O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY

Choose based on your specific file handling needs.
